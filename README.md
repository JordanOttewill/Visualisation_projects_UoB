# Visualisation_projects_UoB
Data visualisation projects from my Masters degree.

CW1 features API pull of COVID19 data and different visualisations of the data within the API pull after convesion into dictionaries and dataframs before data cleansing and manipulation into the desired format for visualisations during pre-procesing.
CW2 involves pre-processing two datasets “OxCRGT_summary20200520.csv” and “country-and-continent.csv” and cleansing the data before use in interactive visualisations via plotly express and scatter geo libraries. Dash libraries were then used to create a dashboard via python code to interactively display results of the dataset. Finally, a MapBox token was obtained before creating a map based visualisation of a journey from London to Istanbul.
